            What is a database? Why would we implement it in our system/website?
          </h4>
          <div class="question-answer">
            <p>
              <b>Database</b> is an organized collection of structured data to make
              it easily accessible, manageable and update. In simple words, you
              can say, a database in a place where the data is stored.
            </p>
            <p>
              We would use it in our website if we wanted to store some
              information permanently so that we could access it later on. For
              example, storing records about products, user login information,
              comments, posts etc.

            What is the advantage of using a relational database management
            system?
          </h4>
          <ul class="question-answer">
            <li>
              <b>Simple Model</b> - does not require any complex structuring or
              querying processes
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Data Accuracy</b> - there can be multiple tables related to one
              another with the use of a primary key and foreign key concepts.
              This makes the data to be non-repetitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Easy Access to Data</b> - Anyone who accesses the data can
              query any table in the relational database. Using join queries and
              conditional statements one can combine all or any number of
              related tables in order to fetch the required data. Resulting data
              can be modified based on the values from any column, on any number
              of columns, which permits the user to effortlessly recover the
              relevant data as the result.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Data Integrity</b> - relational reliability amongst the tables
              in the database helps in avoiding the records from being
              imperfect, isolated or unrelated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Flexibility</b> - possesses qualities for leveling up,
              expanding for bigger lengths, as it is endowed with a bendable
              structure to accommodate the constantly shifting requirements.
              This facilitates the increasing incoming amount of data, as well
              as the update and deletes wherever required.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>High Security</b> - it is possible to make a few tables to be
              tagged as confidential and others not. When a data analyst tries
              to login with a username and password, the database can set
              boundaries for their level of access, by providing admission only
              to the tables that they are allowed to work on, depending on their
              access level.

            Explain the difference between key, primary key and foreign key.

          <div class="question-answer">
            <p>
              <b>Keys</b> are attributes that help you to identify a row in a table. They allow you to find the relationship between two tables.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Primary key</b> is a column or group of columns that uniquely identifies every row in the table of the relational database management system. It cannot be a duplicate, meaning the same value should not appear more than once in the table.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Foreign key</b> is a column that creates a relationship between two tables. The purpose of the Foreign key is to maintain data integrity and allow navigation between two different instances of an entity. It acts as a cross-reference between two tables as it references the primary key of another table.
